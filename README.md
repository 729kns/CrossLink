This is a project repository of the game I'm personally working on.
It's name is â€œCross Link".
It's a rhythm game which all the songs are focusing on Vocaloid Songs.
However, currently there's only 4 songs that I have mapped.
And the development is still ongoing.

check out this youtube video if you are interest. https://youtu.be/aYsZ6wtslFA

It's target platform is Android and IOS, but for the IOS, because of the lack of the development support I could only test it on my own phone, which I can't provide the IOS app package, feel free to build and run by yourself.

And, due to the lack of the songs and illusts copyright, this project will not be used for commercial purposes.

Also please forgive me if my English may be a little weird, as I'm not a native speaker.
